  "I'm a reliable and driven IT graduate majoring in Cyber Security, with strengths in full-stack development, cloud infrastructure (AWS), and secure system & network design. With hands-on experience in both development and leadership roles, I bring a customer-focused mindset and a passion for building impactful tech solutions.";

  export const ABOUT_TEXT = 
  "My passion for technology started early ‚Äî sparked by CQUniversity's robotics competition in primary school. That experience ignited a lifelong curiosity that led me to establish a robotics club in high school and ultimately pursue a Bachelor of Information Technology, majoring in Cyber Security, which I completed with Distinction (GPA: 6.958).\n\n" +
  "I've since gained hands-on experience across both technical and customer-facing roles ‚Äî from supervising customer service teams to working as a software engineer on cloud-based projects. I enjoy solving complex problems and building secure, user-focused solutions that make a tangible impact.\n\n" +
  "Outside of development, you'll find me exploring emerging tech, diving into AI, or helping organise online events in my discord gaming community. I value curiosity, continuous learning, and working with people who are just as passionate about technology and building something meaningful.";
